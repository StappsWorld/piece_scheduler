    synopsis:
      "The series begins with an attack on a cruise ship at the hands of Alvida. Coby, a slave of Alvida, discovers a barrel. One of Alvida's pirates attempts to open the barrel, but a young boy emerges and accidentally hits him. The remaining pirates attack him, but the stranger stops them and says that his name is Monkey D. Luffy. Luffy drags Coby to the storage cellar of the ship, where he eats and converses with Coby, who reveals his dream of being a marine. Alvida confronts Luffy, but he escapes and knocks her pirate crew down with his Devil Fruit power. Luffy explains that he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, therefore he has the properties of rubber. Coby, inspired by Luffy, stands up for himself when Alvida confronts them. Luffy uses his Gum-Gum Pistol technique on Alvida. Luffy and Coby sail away in a \"borrowed\" boat from Alvida's crew. Luffy asks about the pirate hunter Coby mentioned earlier. Coby says that he was captured by the Marines, and Luffy announces his intention of asking him to join his crew. (Source: Wikipedia)",

      "Luffy and Coby arrive at an island with a large Marine base, where Luffy discovers the swordsman, Roronoa Zoro tied to a pole. Rika, a young girl, offers Zoro some rice balls that she made herself. Helmeppo, the son of Marine Captain Morgan, discovers this and has Rika thrown out. Luffy asks Zoro to join his crew, but Zoro refuses and has Luffy give him the rice balls. Luffy and Coby meet Rika in town, who is happy to hear that Zoro enjoyed the rice balls. She tells them how Helmeppo brought his vicious pet dog into their bar and that Zoro knocked it out to protect everyone inside. He then made a deal with Helmeppo: if he can survive being tied to a pole with no food or water for thirty days, then Helmeppo will spare the little girl and her mother. However, Helmeppo says that he will execute Zoro the next day despite his word. Luffy punches him, and Helmeppo runs off to tell his father. While Luffy invades the Navy base to find Zoro's swords, Coby attempts to untie Zoro and explains the situation to him. Morgan orders that they are both to be executed. The soldiers open fire, but before the bullets can reach them, Luffy leaps from the base and uses his rubber body to block the bullets. (Source: Wikipedia)",

      "Before he meets Luffy, Zoro traveled the world in search of \"Hawk-Eye\" Mihawk. In a flashback, Zoro captures the target of the bounty hunters Johnny and Yosaku in a bar. According to bounty hunter rules, they demand that he relinquish the victim's body to them. Zoro, who does not consider himself a bounty hunter, complies, explaining that he only brings in a bounty from time to time so that he can survive until he can become the greatest swordsman in the world. Later that day, a group of bandits, led by a man with a much higher bounty, plunders the village. Johnny and Yosaku, inspired by Zoro's conviction, decide to take on the villain, but are quickly defeated. As the bandits prepare to kill the pair, Zoro returns and saves Johnny and Yosaku. After he defeats the bandits and their leader, Johnny and Yosaku become his followers. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Zenny realizes that the Straw Hats are pirates and sends his goats to attack them. During the fight Zenny's heart stops from fear. The Straw Hats take him to his home, nurse him back to health, and complete his chores, such as cleaning his house, preparing meals, and chopping wood. Zoro searches for food and discovers a small nearly completed pirate ship atop the island's mountain. At the day's end, as the crew is about to leave, Chopper reveals that the old man will die within three days. Driven by guilt, the Straw Hats decide to stay with him until then. (Source: Wikipedia)",

He describes how he was shipwrecked twenty years earlier, and that he, in hopes of one day becoming a pirate, started building a ship. As the years passed, he became too old for a pirate's life.

Since the Straw Hats are the only ones with any chance of matching the CP9 in combat, the Franky Family and the Galley-La foremen intend to be the first wave so the pirates can rush in on Rocketman. As Enies Lobby draws near, the gigantic Gates of Justice appears in the sky behind it. While his crewmates and allies gaze in awe, Luffy ignores the plan and strides past the first of the gates. On the other side of the island, in the Tower of Law (\u53f8\u6cd5\u306e\u5854, Shih\u014d no T\u014d), Chief Spandam and other CP9 agent await the arrival of Rob Lucci's group and their prisoners.

The captain contracted an illness and attempted to leave the Grand Line through the Calm Belt with the other infected crew, leaving Brook in charge of the remaining pirates. The journey continued until some powerful enemies defeated the Rumbar Pirates in the Florian Triangle, fatally poisoning them. As they were dying, they sang Binks's Brew one last time, recording it in a Tone Dial in the hopes that Brook would revive with his Devil Fruit power and deliver the shell to Laboon. Back in the present, Brook silently hopes Laboon will wait just a little longer for his return. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Mr. 1 and Crocodile manage to capture a battleship, but are unable to move it back to the prison quickly enough, forcing the escapees to come up with an alternative plan. Ivankov recovers from the poison and bursts through the floor to reach Luffy. Luffy has Mr. 3 create a large wall of wax that, despite being unable to permanently block Magellan's poison, enables him to push Magellan back with Giant Stamp, and Ivankov uses a Death Wink to launch the prisoners into the ocean, where Jimbei has called whale sharks to carry them to the ship.

Luffy encounters Jango and Fullbody; Jango accidentally hypnotizes himself and Fullbody, and Luffy barely escapes from Hina using Gear Second. Elsewhere, the Whitebeard Pirates are having difficulty getting past the Vice-Admirals, and Squard attempts to sneak past, only to encounter someone. Moria attacks with a group of zombies, halting Luffy's progress, while Marine reinforcements come in.

However, Luffy tells him he does not care, and will save Ace even if he dies. As Jimbei arrives, defeating Moria's zombies with a blast of salt water, and Luffy defeats a giant officer with Gear Third, Sengoku reveals to the Marines that Luffy is the son of Dragon.

      "Jimbei thanks Luffy for what he has done to him. Vowing to meet again at Fishman Island, Jimbei and Luffy go their separate ways. At Rayleigh's request, Hancock's ship lands on a Ruskaina, an abandoned island northwest of Maiden Island. As Hancock and Luffy go their separate ways, Rayleigh tells Luffy about the island. Luffy tries to attack a large elephant with Gear Second, but it fails. Rayleigh teaches Luffy two Haki techniques, using the first technique, Observation Haki - a power feeling a person's presence - to avoid the elephant's attack. Rayleigh then knocks out the elephant with Armament Haki, another technique used as an invisible shield and can render a Logia-type Devil Fruit user unconscious. Rayleigh also reveals that the Armament Haki can be transferred to a weapon. When the elephant tries to attack again, Rayleigh finally defeats it using the Conqueror's Haki, a rare type of Haki that can only be awakened by a user. Luffy promises to Rayleigh that he will stay for the next two years to control his Haki techniques and prepare to reunite with his crew. The next day, Luffy begins his training with Rayleigh.

Meanwhile, at Ryugu Palace, the Minister of the Left accuses the Straw Hats for the conspiracy of destroying the Island and kidnapping the mermaids. Luffy saves the princess by stopping the axe. When the palace guards rush in, the princess hides Luffy and is told that the Straw Hat Pirates will be detained in the castle's dungeons, as Zoro has been captured. The princess apologizes for her rudeness and allows Luffy to eat her food, revealing that her name is Shirahoshi. She then reveals that she was in the tower for 10 years. After being accidentally insulted by Luffy, Shirahoshi reveals that she wants to see a lot of places and Luffy immediately orders her to leave with him. Meanwhile, Nami, Usopp and Brook confront the palace guards just as Zoro, who has escaped from the guards, arrives.

Hordy continues to chase Shirahoshi and Luffy but a Gear Second Jet Bazooka is unable to defeat Hordy, the fishman laughs that everything he holds dear will be destroyed. Undeterred, Luffy prepares to attack Hordy, he enters Gear Second and imbues Busoshoku Haki into his arm, setting it on fire despite being underwater, and uses his Gum Gum Red Hawk technique, on Hordy with enough force to send the flames though his chest and blasting out of his back. The New Fishman Pirates are terrified to hear their captain was defeated but the officers force the others to stay and die for hatred. The rest of the Straw Hats continue fighting, meanwhile Luffy and Hordy are on Noah and Luffy sees Hordy overdosing on the Energy Steroids even more. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Luffy regroups with the rest of the crew away from the party after Jimbei requested to talk with him and Jimbei explains that Akainu fought against Aokiji for the title of Fleet Admiral on a certain island. Akainu won the title and Aokiji left since he didn't want to work for Akainu. He also explains the two changes that happened in the new world after two years which is Akainu becoming fleet admiral and Marshall D. Teach taking all of Whitebeard's territories and claiming the title of \"Yonko\" among Shanks, Charlotte Linlin and Kaido. Jimbei also claims that Blackbeard is searching for the strongest Devil Fruits so he can extract their abilities and claim them for his own use, with Chopper fearing that he'll be targeted next and Usopp saying that Blackbeard wouldn't want his Human-Human fruit ability. Luffy doesn't listen to Jimbei's blabbing and Luffy sees Keimi and asks where Shirahoshi is and she says that she is in her room. Luffy senses a \"big animal\" in the palace so he calls Zoro and Sanji to come with him and they find Caribou using his Logia powers to capture Shirahoshi. Luffy kicks him out and Minister of the Right thanks him once again. Minister of the Right wonders why the tower has been cut into pieces and Pappug says that Zoro did it and Zoro gets mad. After hearing Minister of the Right say that Caribou had stolen all the treasure from the vault and that Neptune would give it all to them, Nami reprimands Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji for not tying Caribou up and angrily kicks them out to find him and get the treasure back. Meanwhile in Hordy's cell, Hordy and his crew appear to be aged by the energy steroids that they used, which was later revealed to be aging pills, and still sought vengeance against the royal family, the Straw Hats, and humans. As everyone leaves Hordy's cell, Hordy yells at Fukaboshi for \"betraying his kind.\" Fukaboshi answers by saying that he won't hold vengeance on Hordy for killing his mother and orders him to shut up so the children won't here him and be tainted by his evil. Soon, the Minister of the Left gets news that Baron Tamago and Pekoms, crew members of the Big Mom Pirates, are in Fishman Island going to receive the monthly payment of sweets. With the candy factory destroyed and all the excess candy given to the Straw Hats to eat at the banquet, the Fishman Island can't pay their monthly payment.

However, Keimi fears that Madam Sharley still believes that Luffy will destroy the Fishman Island because she knows that her predictions are always right.

The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World.

Chopper claims he is scared and he won't eat the cloud. Meanwhile Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin are hanging out.

Luffy faces off against Shuzo but starts to be overpowered by Shuzo and Alpacacino. Lily attempts to go inside Shuzo to explode him by growing to full size, but he senses her intentions using Haki & uses Luffy as a shield so that she ends up inside Luffy instead. Lilly then takes advantage of the situation and turns Luffy into a giant with a combination of her ability and Luffy's rubbery form. Luffy defeats Shuzo and his pet alpaca and the group gets to eat the heavenly food from Panz Fry before parting ways with Lilly & Pans Fry and setting off for another adventure in the New World. Meanwhile, Ain is talking with Zephyr, where it is revealed to him that Shuzo lost. Ain takes the blame, but Zephyr does not care since neither Shuzo nor his men will tell the marines anything. Therefore, they begin their assault on the first island in the New World, which leads to Film Z. (Source: Wikipedia)",

He says that she doesn't have the right to tell him when or how she can die and she tries to attack him with her broken sword. She misses and Law prepares to slice her into more pieces. Luckily, Smoker steps in and takes on a fight with Law. Back at Luffy's group, the beaten centaurs talk about how they underestimated the Straw Hats and how they took Brownbeard with them. While they contemplate on that, Luffy, Zoro, Brook, Robin, and Usopp ride Brownbeard to the mysterious building that Brook saw. In the lab, a hazmat guy tells the mysterious smoke man that Law and Smoker were in a fight and that the children escaped with Nami's group and that Smoker saw the children. The smoke man became very angry but knew that if he tried to kill Smoker, the navy would think that something was up. Just then, the Harpy that Usopp saw, Monet, informs the smoke man that the pirates they captured were the Straw Hats and that Luffy's group beat Vegapunk's dragon and the centaurs and were on their way to the facility. The smoke man finally decides to kill the Straw Hats and the G-5. Although the hazmat guy warns him that the navy would be on the alert, the smoke mans says they would just have to suppress things on the island from now on. He then tells Monet to call a man called Joker. Back with Sanji's group, the children begin to realize that Nami, Sanji, Chopper, and Franky switched bodies. They also start to get cold. Sanji states that he doesn't care about anyone anymore and asks if someone has a camera so he can take a picture of himself in Nami's body. When a child falls and complains that it is cold, Franky begins to say that it was a bad idea to bring the kids if they didn't have a plan. Back at the main entrance to the facility, Smoker and Law are still fighting as the G-5 are watching and putting themselves back together outside Law's bubble. As the fighting continues, the G-5 try to figure out why Law was fighting them even though he was a warlord. Tashigi tries to fight and the G-5 stop her. She then reflects on what Smoker told her two years ago: \"Pirates will be pirates.\" Closing in on the fight, Smoker and Law fight so viciously, that Law's recoils cut up everything in the way. Smoker then begins to ask him why he was on the island, with Law saying nothing. Back to Tashigi, she begins to remember what Smoker said after the incident at Enies lobby. She remembers him saying that they have to be promoted and that he would kick the asses of the Straw Hats in the New World. In the fight, Smoker tells Law that he never trusted the Warlords and as Smoker charges at him, Law says under his breath, \"Maybe that's the right thing to do,\" and begins to make stone spikes rise from the ground in Smoker's direction to get him. Although Smoker was able to dodge most of them, Law rises one from under him and Smoker gets jabbed. As he drops his jitte, Smoker once again asks why Law was on the island and the two begin to fight again. Law finally answers the question by asking why the G-5 were here. Law pushes Smoker back and Smoker tries to jab Law but instead breaks through a stone spike that Law rose from the ground. As he ducks from the attack, Law tell Smoker that from his current standing he couldn't see a few things and poked out his heart. Law takes the heart and his sword and says that he doesn't have to say anything to Smoker. With his heart outside of his body, Smoker collapses. (Source: Wikipedia)",

      "Luffy finally reaches Caesar's room and immediately punches the scientist, while Smoker leaves in order to find Vergo. Meanwhile, Sanji faces off Vergo while the passage between buildings A and B is closing and the previous one is opening, letting the poison gas enter. During the fight with Caesar, he tries to drain the oxygen in the area to kill Luffy, but fails once he enters Gear Second and use some attacks with Haki, making the scientist angry to the point of using some techniques as oxygen-made sword and fire bursts. Meanwhile, both Sanji and Vergo start running away from the gas. During this fight, Trafalgar Law makes his way to building D, where the SAD is made and Monet decides to enter the fight to protect Caesar, while he flies away, and reveals her snow abilities.

When one of Caesar's subordinates questions the nature of the gas, Caesar then makes a speech to his subordinates, saying that the poisonous gas bomb four years ago was Vegapunk's doing and that Caesar tried to stop him. However, in a flashback it is revealed that Caesar constructed the weapon himself, and when he was told to stop and banished from the science squad, he set it off.

After the feast the Straw Hats are about to set sail and leave. While they are seeing the kids off, G-5 starts insulting them and they put up a barricade so the children can't see them. The children are crying and are sad and they remember how the Straw Hats helped them and say they want to say good-bye. G-5 continues to insult them and says that pirates are evil and the navy is justice, the children are still crying. Tashigi tells them to stop insulting them, but they say that if they stop they'll start to like them and then they start crying. The Straw Hats and Law then head to the Thousand Sunny. Zoro asks why Law is going with them and Usopp tells him that Luffy got them into more trouble. Doflamingo is still flying but then stops when he sees the life raft from his tanker. He sees Baby 5 and Buffalo's heads on it and a Den Den Mushi that resembles Law. Law tells Doflamingo that they have Caesar and says that since he can't produce SMILE anymore his business partner, Kaido will kill him. Doflamingo tries to negotiate with him but Law says that there is only one thing he can do: resign from being a Warlord. It shocks everyone on the raft and then Law says that if it is not in the paper by tomorrow morning he won't give back Caesar and hangs up. Doflamingo then gets angry and starts cursing Law.

      "Upon their arrival to Green Bit, the group discovers a Marine ship that crashed and believed that the Marines had landed on the island. With fourteen minutes left before the exchange, Robin and Usopp begin to scout the island as Law takes Caesar to the meeting point. As they explore, Robin and Usopp discover a squad of Marines who are getting attacked by the forest's inhabitants, losing all of their belongings. As soon as the Marines fled, Robin uses her Devil Fruit power to capture the fast and seemingly invisible thieves. Usopp asks her what she has caught, and she tells him that she believes they are dwarves. Meanwhile at Acacia, Zoro has captured his sword thief, a dwarf named Wicca, who berated herself for being caught. Because the fall sprained her ankle, she begged Zoro to take her to the flower field to deliver a report that the Donquixote family is planning to attack the Straw Hats ship. Zoro had no choice but to take her with him due to his horrible sense of direction. With Violet revealing her true self, Sanji was seen beaten and bloodied before Violet who was actually an assassin sent to interrogate him about Law's plan. Her Glare-Glare Fruit power allows her to look into Sanji's mind for the truth, only to recoil from seeing Sanji's perverted mind. Sanji, who was barely conscious, told her that he never doubted her tears, leaving her genuinely shocked, brought to tears by his honesty. (Source: Wikipedia)",

In the Flower Fields, Gancho reveals to Usopp, Robin, and Franky the cruelty of the Donquixote Family from 800 years ago, and how the Dwarfs were slaved up until the rise of the Riku Family. The dwarfs all agree that Doflamingo's presence is a terrible thing for the country, and that an incident framed King Dold as a villain so he is undeservedly hated by Dressrosa today. Finally, the Thunder Soldier reveals that he is Rebecca's father. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Then, Doflamingo appears with his strongest subordinates and defeats the king and his army, setting the grounds for his takeover of the island. After telling the Straw Hat Pirates of the tragedies of the past, Thunder Soldier explains that the king is still alive since Viola pledged her service to Doflamingo in exchange for the King's life. He, also, explained that although the toys of Dressrosa were once people who despised Doflamingo, they still remember who they were, but not each other and that the drive for revolution is still in them. Thunder Soldier also explains that the reason for their rebellion was the news of Doflamingo resignation was false, shocking Usopp, Robin and Franky, who realize they unintentionally caused the rebellion. In the underground chamber, almost all of the fighters were transformed except for Riku and Chinjao, with the latter having mysteriously forgotten that he had grandchildren. In the colosseum, Luffy meets up with Zoro and Kin'emon with the help of Bartolomeo, although he was nowhere to be seen. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Leo survives and lands near Usopp and Robin who evaded capture. Leo weakly told Usopp that their plan must succeed for the sake of their captain. At the Palace, Thunder Soldier was brutally kicked out of the lift by Lao G, and has a flashback of his fight with Rebecca over the false news of Doflamingo's resignation. At the Colosseum, Rebecca lies beaten by Diamante who taunts her over the death of her mother. Seeing this, Lucy tells Bartolomeo to protect Rebecca. Thunder Soldier was later saved by his dwarf squad from Lao G, and the survivors told him that he must press on. Usopp was skeptical that they would put all their faith on a simple toy soldier, but Leo reveals that Thunder Soldier was the first to be turned into a toy and not given a contract. It is why he leads the resistance and that his human identity was the legendary gladiator, Kyros. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Angry at being used like a hammer, Kyuin rants about torturing Franky, who walks up to her and kisses her, shocking the dwarves and herself. Senor Pink recovers and tells Kyuin to shut up as her rants are interrupting their man's fight, which promptly resumes. While Viola is looking for the princess' whereabouts, Kin'emon and Kanjuro arrive at her location. Usopp warns them of the mob coming after them, but Kanjuro has made things worse by drawing a net for the citizens to climb. Zoro is still fighting Pica after helping Robin's group move past them. Leo, who is with Rebecca, gets a call from Maujii, the dwarf princess' aide who informs Leo that princess Mansherry is not in the factory and could be in the palace. Leo then relays the info to Viola and Usopp who was getting agitated at the citizens coming after them, but Viola tells him that the citizens will not harm them. King Riku then comments that Doflamingo will not kill Mansherry since he needs her ability just as much as they do. The scene shifts to the dwarf princess who is kept in a room crying her eyes out for Leo to save her. (Source: One Piece Wikia)",

      "At dinner, Doflamingo discusses their next target who has been allying with other groups as Law walks in. Machvise points out a white patch on Law's chest and Jora recognizes it as Amber Lead Syndrome, but Doflamingo angrily tells her not to spread rumors, explaining how it's caused by poisoning. When asked how he escaped Flevance, Law reveals that he hid under a mountain of corpses. Doflamingo asks Law who he holds a grudge against, prompting Law to claim he wants to destroy everything and telling Corazon that he will get his revenge at any cost. The next day, the Donquixote Pirates executives attack a pirate hideout and take their treasure. Baby 5 asks what Flevance was like and learn how it is a white city caused by the Amber Lead and used to create different types of goods. But, it would poison and erode the body if dug up and handled, something the World Government and Flevance royalty kept secret because of the fortune it would bring. It also consequentially shortening the lifespan by about 20 more years each generation, effectively killing the kids before adulthood. People eventually began to collapse at the same time due to the buildup of Amber Lead in their bodies and began to die with immense pain flooding their bodies. Surrounding countries placed a quarantine on Flevance because they thought it was contagious and the royalty escaped with the help of the World Government. However, Flevance wouldn't remain quiet as war broke out with neighboring countries showing no mercy. In the past, Flevance citizens were killed as soldiers gun down anyone they find. A nun tries to get Law to come with her and the other children after some soldiers promised to let them escape, but Law stays because his sister is dying. The nun promises to come back on the next ship to get Law and tells him that there is always hope and that a loving hand will one day reach out to him. Law's father tries to get help from other doctors but none will come, afraid of becoming infected. Elsewhere, Law stands next to his sister, Lami, who tells him that her body hurts and is turning more white every day. Law holds her hand and promises that their father will find a cure because he is the greatest doctor in the country. As soldiers gun down civilians outside, Lami asks Law why it is so noisy, prompting Law to lie about there being a festival going on because Flevance is always prosperous. Soldiers enter the hospital to kill anybody they find and Law hides Lami in a closet, but finds his parents killed and screams in grief. Law leaps through a window as the soldiers fire at him and runs away in tears as they pursue him. He hides under a bridge and finds the children and nun lying dead, causing him to fall into tears while remembering the nun's words about hope. He returns to the hospital, but finds it burning and suffers a complete mental breakdown screaming Lami's name. In the present, Senor Pink reveals that Flevance perished as the Donquixote Pirates finish off the pirates and notes that any 10-year old who experienced that would have their personality screwed up. Law walks through the garbage dump and sees Corazon reading a newspaper. Law notes that his family and everyone from Flevance died while Corazon lived claiming it's not fair. Holding a dagger, Law lunges toward Corazon and stabs in the back, but gets caught by Buffalo who exclaims that he must inform Doflamingo. (Source: Wikipedia)",

      "Luffy continues to persuade Bellamy to stop stating Doflamingo isn't worth dying for. Bellamy refuses to listen and continues his assault on Luffy. Mansherry attempts to flirt with Leo and asks him to carry her since she hurt her legs. Leo obliviously thinks her selfish side showed up and says she can just heal herself since she's always been very fast. This upsets Mansherry stating she's not running and didn't ask Leo to save her. Leo is angered about her mood swings and is whacked over the head by Kabu telling him to just carry her stating they don't have time to mess around. Leo carries her on his back complaining about her attitude while the Princess is happy to have him carry her while Kabu notes Leo is so thick, noting that Mansherry is polite and kind to everyone but Leo due to her feelings for him. Just as they leave Jora regains consciousness commenting she must alert Doflamingo immediately. Knowing his calculations of Mansherry's Chiyu Chiyu no Mi powers to restore anything at the cost of one's lifespan, that should anything happen to the SMILE Factory, it can easily be restored to its original form. She is unable to move and pleads with Senor Pink to protect it at all cost. At the SMILE factory, Franky and Pink are still at it with the cyborg landing a Strong Hammer on Pink's face. However, Pink uses the momentum to dive underground and grab Franky from behind using his MeowMeow Suplex again. Both then fall over exhausted from their injuries. The Dwarves and fans alike note they are both at their limit while asking them both why they don't dodge their attacks, stating they took them both on 30 times each. Franky states when a man is offered a drink he can't turn away from it stating Pink is a hard man. He shouts he will not dodge a single attack and take them all one and come out on top saying that is his \"strong style\". He knows the Dwarves are worried but it is a duel between men and promises he will win in his own way and won't let them become slaves again. Senor Pink is touched by these words and states he'll remember them stating he's not as young as he used to be and will finish this with the next move, prompting one of his fans to note how far away he is. He then asks if what Franky said is true and that men don't go back on their word if he takes his attack without dodging. He swims towards Franky telling him to try to survive this next move proclaiming if he does survive he will admit defeat and take any punishment from Franky. Franky says it's a deal while being grabbed by Pink and swam outside the factory up a tower, much to the shock of the Dwarves. Pink notes how the sky is darker than usual wishing he could keep going up higher to see his wife Russian and his son Gimlet but gravity is between them, prompting Franky to ask what he means. Pink reveals he knew of Franky's cyborg body and how is back is his weak spot and unleashes a devastating attack called \"Baby Buster\" crashing Franky into the ground. As Pink emerges seemingly victorious, he turns around shocked to see Franky, who's left eye seems to be more cybernetic now, emerges from the rubble. Pink keeps true to his word and admits defeat while apologizing to the Young Master. Franky unleashes a brutal \"Franky Iron Boxing\" on Pink, thrashing him around with his enlarged fists. While being assaulted, Pink reminisces the first time he met Russian on a rainy day for their first date. When she says she hates pirates she asks Pink what he does and he lies about being a banker. In time they marry and have a son named Gimlet. He juggles his duties to his family and crew and returns one day to discover of Gimlet's death. Russian reveals he had a fever a week ago just as Pink disappeared and the doctor's couldn't help him. She reveals his lies shouting she called the bank and they never heard of him demanding to know who he really is. She angrily slaps him and runs off telling him to not follow her. However, she fell in a landslide from the rain and sand and was buried on top leaving her in a vegetative state stating she does not have long to live. Pink can only grieve over her condition blaming himself for her and Gimlet's fates. He then regularly visits her for the next year doing everything in his power to get her to smile again. He wishes to hear her voice and see her smile even a little so he puts on Gimlet's bonnet since he had his face. Just as he puts it away thinking it wasn't funny he's shocked to see Russian smile.

The location of the fourth Ponegliff is unknown. Usopp suggests they sneak into Big Mom and Kaido's headquarters and steal a copy of the Road Ponegliffs (by painting and taking a stamp off the original). Robin is warned that the Yonkos and the other pirates are only looking for the Ponegliffs at the moment, but none of them can decipher the Ponegliffs. Since Robin is the only one who can decipher them, she will be targeted for kidnapping. Robin says she's confident she'll be protected by her friedns. Master Cat tells the crew that Kozuki clan were very skilled stone masons who were responsible for sculpting the Ponegliffs. Kozuki Oden was the last in the line of Kozuki who knew how to read the language inscribed on the Ponegliffss. Oden was executed by the current shogun of the Land of Wano and Kaido, Captain of the Beast Pirates since he had traveled to Raftel with Gol D. Roger. Meanwhile, Jack wakes up and is informed that Sheepshead is back onboard. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Judge discovered that Sanji possessed no superhuman abilities after all, and he faked Sanji's death, locking his third son in a dungeon with an iron mask on to act like he never existed.

Meanwhile, Sanji visits Reiju in the medical center and informs her of the memories Pudding erased. Reiju insists that Sanji escapes, but still plans to attend the wedding herself and allow Germa 66 to be taken out at the expense of her own life. Reiju explains that when their mother Sora was pregnant she was strongly opposed to the surgery planned for her sons, as it would make them extremely strong but also emotionless; Sora took a drug to undo the surgery's effects which left her weakened and was only successful on Sanji. While Judge blames Sanji for Sora's death, Reiju tells him that Sora never regretted her actions due to Sanji being a kind child. (Source: Wikpedia)",

Carmel ran an orphanage called the Sheep's House and she took Linlin in. The Elbaf village prepares for the Winter Solstice Festival. The villagers and the Sheep's House children feast on semla prior to the twelve-day fast. On the seventh day of the fast, Linlin lost control and goes on a rampage for semla. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Jarl prepared to avenge Jorl, but Carmel begged him to spare Linlin, saying that she would leave Elbaf with her. Jorl died and this incident earned Linlin the hatred of the giants. Carmel and the children of the Sheep's House moved to a different island. Carmel had a secret meeting with Cipher Pol, negotiating on selling Linlin to the World Government. The Sheep's House children later celebrated Linlin's sixth birthday. After feasting on some sweets, Linlin discovered that Carmel and the other orphans disappeared. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Luffy hands Balloon over to the nearby sorcerer pirate Speil, but gets imprisoned on Spiel\'s ship after insulting him. Luffy is trapped with Anne, a close friend of Balloon who explains that Spiel is after his magic blood and has kidnapped her as bait. Luffy in turn mentions that he was inspired by his pirate grandfather, and as a child unknowingly ate the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit belonging to him. Luffy uses his rubber powers to break them both out but is uninteresting in saving Balloon. Spiel shoots Anne after discovering her unlocking Balloon\'s cage and attacks Luffy when insulted again. Losing the fight and having obtained the Ruku he was after, Spiel destroys his ship with his former crew still aboard and uses Balloon to escape.
